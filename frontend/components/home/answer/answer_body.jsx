            There are three body parts that you must keep clean, even on the
            battlefield. If one of those parts gets infected or causes you any
            other trouble, the war will be over for you: Your teeth I always had
            a toothbrush with me. I used the plastic bags from the MRE combat
            rations to protect the brush from dirt. You get used to cleaning
            your teeth while doing something else at the same time (like
            watching the terrain, listening to an officer giving orders or
            checking your rifle). There is really no excuse for not brushing
            your teeth. Your butt You can use wet wipes to wipe your ass. If you
            don't have any, try to clean your butt (and your genitals as well)
            with water from time to time. You should also change your underwear
            whenever you can. There is always some space in your backpack to
            take some spare underwear with you.
